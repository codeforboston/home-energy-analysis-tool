Design temperature

The 99% ASHRAE heating design temperature is XX°F  
*where XX is the design temperature looked up based on the county where the home is located*  
Helper text: You can override the default 99% ASHRAE heating design temperature associated with the home’s location by entering a value in this field. HVAC contractors often use a lower temperature such as 0℉ or 5℉ when performing a Manual J analysis. When comparing this heat load analysis with a Manual J analysis, enter the same design temperature as the Manual J analysis.
