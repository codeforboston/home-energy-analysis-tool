title: Help for Design Temperature Override

markdown: The heating design temperature is the coldest outdoor temperature for which the heating system should be capable of supplying sufficient heat to maintain an indoor temperature of 70°F. The default is to use a County-Level Design Temperature obtained from an [ENERGY STAR guide](https://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/bldrs_lenders_raters/downloads/County%20Level%20Design%20Temperature%20Reference%20Guide%20-%202015-06-24.pdf). However, there are sometimes reasons to override the default value by entering a different value in the _Design Temperature Override_ field, including:

- The user wants to compare the output from this tool with a Manual J analysis. In this case, enter an override value that matches the heating design temperature used in the Manual J analysis 

- The user judges that the default value is too low or too high. In general, values obtained from the ENERGY STAR guide appear to be very conservative (lower than necessary) because the guide is based on the lowest ASHRAE 99% heating design temperature among all weather stations within a county. The guide cites an EPA recommendation to use the ASHRAE 99% heating design temperature for the weather station that is geographically closest to a home, which will often give a higher value when there are multiple weather stations within a county.

-  A different value specified by the local jurisdiction (uncommon)
