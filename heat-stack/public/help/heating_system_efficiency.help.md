Design temperature

The 99% ASHRAE heating design temperature is XX°F  
*where XX is the design temperature looked up based on the county where the home is located*  
Helper text: You can override the default 99% ASHRAE heating design temperature associated with the home’s location by entering a value in this field. HVAC contractors often use a lower temperature such as 0℉ or 5℉ when performing a Manual J analysis. When comparing this heat load analysis with a Manual J analysis, enter the same design temperature as the Manual J analysis.

Download up to 36 months of natural gas usage from your utility in .*csv* format (Eversource and National Grid data formats are currently supported). Upload the *.csv* file here. In general, the more months of fuel usage data available the more accurate the results.

Titles for output graphs:

Heating System Demand
This graph shows the rate that heat must be supplied to the home by the heating system to maintain a thermostat set point of 70℉. The heating system demand at the design temperature is useful for judging whether a proposed heat pump system has adequate heating capacity or not.

Whole-home heat loss comparison graph

This graph compares the heat-loss rate of this home with other homes that have been analyzed with the same method. The heat-loss rate is independent of the thermostat settings and balance point. This comparison provides an indication of a home’s weatherization quality. A home that is above the trendline has a higher heat-loss rate than typical homes of the same size, which may indicate poor weatherization. A home that is below the trendline has a lower heat-loss rate than typical homes of the same size, which may indicate better weatherization.
