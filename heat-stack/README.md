### H.E.A.T. frontend app docs:

In GitHub CodingSpace:
- `nvm use 18` to avoid engine error with node v19+ which is default. nvm is preinstalled in coding spaces.

- After updating pyodide with `npm install`, you must run this command to update the wasm files:
`cp ./node_modules/pyodide/* public/pyodide-env/`
- To add pyodide dependencies like `numpy`, extract them from [a full 150+mb release](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases) and upload the wasm file into the `public/pyodide-env` folder.

To re-create the patch for py file support in `/patch` using [instruction](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/2468#discussioncomment-2639271):
- edit the `node_modules/@remix-run/dev/dist/modules.d` file to add py, just like sql format.
- edit the `node_modules/@remix-run/dev/dist/compiler/utils/loader.ts` to add py, just like sql format.
- `npx patch-package @remix-run/dev`
- it should auto-apply any time you do `npm install`, but it may get out of sync with upstream
