## H.E.A.T. Frontend Setup Documentation

This guide will help you set up the frontend application for the Home Energy
Analysis Tool (H.E.A.T.) project. Please follow these instructions carefully.

### Prerequisites

#### Install Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)

Git LFS is required to manage large files in the repository. Choose one of the
methods below to install it:

**Method 1: Using Homebrew (Recommended)**

```bash
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

**Method 2: Manual Installation**

1. Download the Git LFS installer from [git-lfs.com](https://git-lfs.com/).
2. Unzip the downloaded file and navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/git-lfs-<version>
   ```
3. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   git lfs install
   ```
4. Confirm the installation with:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

For more details, visit the
[official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

---

### Repository Setup

1. **Fork the repository**  
   Go to the
   [home-energy-analysis-tool repository](https://github.com/codeforboston/home-energy-analysis-tool)
   and click the "Fork" button at the top right to create your own copy of the
   repository.

2. **Clone your forked repository**  
   After forking, clone your fork to your local machine using the following
   command (replace `your-username` with your GitHub username):

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your-username/home-energy-analysis-tool.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory**  
   Change into the `heat-stack` directory within the project:

   ```bash
   cd home-energy-analysis-tool/heat-stack
   ```

---

### Node.js Setup

The project requires Node.js version 22.
[Use Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)
for managing Node.js versions (nvm is preinstalled in coding spaces).

#### Install NVM (Official Method)

1. Download and install NVM:
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
   ```
   If curl does not work, please download node.js manually: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current
   If using mac, install with `brew install nvm`.

2. Restart your terminal. Ensure NVM is installed by running:
   ```bash
   nvm --version
   ```
3. Install Node.js version 22:
   ```bash
   nvm install 22
   ```
4. Use Node.js version 22:
   ```bash
   nvm use 22
   ```

---

### Install Dependencies and Build

1. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the rules engine into the `public/pyodide-env` folder:
   ```bash
   npm run buildpy
   ```
3. Setup the SQLite Database:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
4. Copy the example environment file into a new `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

If you encounter errors during this process, try the following steps:

- Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  ```
- Reinstall dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Run the development server again:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

---

### Setting Up in GitHub Codespaces

If using GitHub Codespaces, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd heat-stack
   ```
2. Create an environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Use Node.js version 22:
   ```bash
   nvm install 22
   nvm use 22
   ```
4. Install dependencies and build:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run buildpy
   npm run setup
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Disable auto-save in VSCode (this is to avoid auto recompiling and page
   refresh while making changes):
   - Go to **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings**.
   - Search for "Auto Save" and uncheck it.
   - For reference, see
     [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76659316/14144258).

### Committing your changes
Before committing your changes, go to the `heat-stack` directory and run `source prepare.sh` from the terminal to format
your code via `Prettier`.
---

### Handling Special Cases

#### Updating Pyodide

If the version of Pyodide changes or you encounter issues with the Pyodide
environment:

1. Copy the necessary Pyodide files:
   ```bash
   cp ./node_modules/pyodide/* public/pyodide-env/
   ```
2. Ensure the correct `numpy` wheel file is in the `public/pyodide-env` folder.
   If missing:
   - Download the latest Pyodide release from
     [Pyodide releases](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases).
   - Extract the file and locate the `numpy` wheel file.
   - Copy it into the `public/pyodide-env` folder.
3. Check the Pyodide version:
   ```bash
   npm list pyodide
   ```
   Ensure the `numpy` file matches the version.

#### Fixing Loader Errors

If you encounter a loader error, run:

```bash
npm run postinstall
```

---

### Additional Notes

- The `npm audit fix` command can resolve minor dependency issues.
- For a clean setup, ensure sufficient disk space (at least 1GB).
