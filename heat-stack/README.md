## H.E.A.T. frontend app docs

### On your computer

```
git clone git@github.com:codeforboston/home-energy-analysis-tool.git
# create an environment file
cd heat-stack
cp .env.example .env

# make sure you're using node version 18
npm install -g nvm
nvm use 20

# install and patch the environment
npm install
npm run buildpy # to build rules engine into `public/pyodide-env`
npm run dev
```

### Set up in a new GitHub CodingSpace:

```
# create an environment file
cp .env.example .env

nvm use 20
npm install
npm run buildpy # to build rules engine into `public/pyodide-env`
npm run dev
```

If you have the node version manager (`nvm`), then `nvm use 18` avoids engine error with node v19+ or newer which is default. nvm is preinstalled in coding spaces.


In Coding Spaces VSCode always go to hamburger menu -> File-> untick AutoSave. For a pic, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/76659316/14144258

### Under special circumstances:

Assume you don't need to, but if the version of pyodide changes run:

```
cp ./node_modules/pyodide/* public/pyodide-env/
```

If the pyodide wheel for `numpy` for your version of `pyodide` isn't in `public/pyodide-env`:

- Make sure you have enough space on your computer for 1GB
- Download [a full 150+mb release](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases) onto your own computer. The filename is something like `pyodide-<some version number>.tar.bz2`.
- Double click it to extract it. It will take about 1GB to decompress.
- Upload the `numpy` .whl file into the `public/pyodide-env` folder.

How do you know if your version of `numpy` is right? You can check your version of pyodide by running `npm list pyodide`. You should check that the `numpy` .whl file name includes the same version number as the output of that command.

If you get an error saying you don't have the right loader:

```
npm run postinstall
```

It fixes the loader problem by doing the following programatically:

To re-create the patch for py file support in `/patch`, use these [instructions](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/2468#discussioncomment-2639271):
- edit the `node_modules/@remix-run/dev/dist/modules.d` file to add py, just like sql format.
- edit the `node_modules/@remix-run/dev/dist/compiler/utils/loader.ts` to add py, just like sql format.
- `npx patch-package @remix-run/dev`
- it should auto-apply any time you do `npm install`, but it may get out of sync with upstream
